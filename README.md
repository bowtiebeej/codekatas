# Code Katas

This is a collection of code katas I've done as I'm learning to code. It is divided up into folders for each language I use. Currently that is limited to C# and JavaScript.

* Happy Primes
    A happy prime is a number that is both happy and prime. A number is considered prime if it is only divisible by itself and one. A happy number is one in which the sum of the square of the digits iterated down eventually equals one whereas an unhappy or sad number will continue indefinitely.
